# Code Examples and Exercises Repository  

Welcome to my repository! This space was created to organize and share various code examples and practical exercises I‚Äôve developed in different programming languages. The goal is to serve as a learning and practice hub, both for myself and for others who are interested.  

## üöÄ Goals  
- Consolidate knowledge in different programming languages by solving diverse exercises and challenges.  
- Share learning and solutions with the community, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.  
- Track my progress in programming and problem-solving through practical examples and projects.  
- Solve problems from the **Beecrowd** platform (formerly URI Online Judge) to improve skills in algorithm design, competitive programming, and mathematical problem-solving.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Work in Progress  
I‚Äôm currently reorganizing folders and files to make the repository more accessible and user-friendly. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
